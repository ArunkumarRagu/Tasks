# Chart Generator - Bar Chart

## Description

The Chart Generator is a simple web application that allows users to create customizable bar charts based on their input data. This application uses Chart.js, a popular charting library, to render the bar charts. Users can input data for each day of the week, and the application will generate a bar chart representing the weekly sales. The bar chart's appearance can be customized with a title and different colors for each day of the week.
